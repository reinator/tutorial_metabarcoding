# Part 3.2 - Purging and Merqury drUrtUren1

Ok, today you learned about Purge Dups and purging assemblies. You also learned that Hifiasm and other assemblers are not perfect in separating haplotypes of diploid species, and then many times the primary assembly retains haplotigs, and that this redanduncy is not real and must be removed before assemblies are scaffolded. Later, you learned how to evaluate assembly completeness and quality having a look at the shared kmers between the assembly and high-quality reads kmers, such as Illumina or PacBio HiFi. Now you are going to run merqury to evaluate assemblies for your species!

All right, earlier today you have assembled a subset of reads for your species, but you have generated statistics for hifiasm drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.p_ctg.fa.gz and drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.a_ctg.fa.gz assemblies that I have generated previously. These assemblies are the files you are going to work on right now. So I would like you to create a directory called `merqury_hifiasm_eval` inside your home species directory (`~/<species_folder>/`), move there and create a symlink to the Hifiasm assembly files: 

```console  
mkdir ~/<species_folder>/merqury_hifiasm_eval/
cd ~/<species_folder>/merqury_hifiasm_eval/
ln -s ~/Share/<species_id>_data/drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.p_ctg.fa.gz
ln -s ~/Share/<species_id>_data/drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.a_ctg.fa.gz
```  


Right, so in order to run merqury, you need a meryl datase of the reads you want to compare kmers with the kmers in your assembly. In our case, I have created meryl databases for Pacbio HiFi reads for your species, and you just need to symlink the meryl db folder to your execution folder. So you do:

```console  
ln -s ~/Share/<species_id>_data/drUrtUren1.pacbio.k21.meryl/
```  

Now, let's run merqury! For that, you need to activate our conda enviroment (if not yet activated):

```console  
conda activate eukaryotic_genome_assembly
```  

Right, as soon as you see it's activated, try:

```console  
merqury.sh
```  

The help message should show you that in order to run merqury, you need (i) the meryl database (ii) your assembly (one or two, if you have primary and haplotigs. In our case you have two) and (iii) an output name. So inside your merqury_hicanu_eval directory, you will do:

```console  
merqury.sh drUrtUren1.pacbio.k21.meryl drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.p_ctg.fa.gz drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.a_ctg.fa.gz hifiasm
```  

Great!! 

## This will take a while to run. During this time...

You are going to gather the results and evaluate the purged version of your species Hifiasm assembly. We don't have time to run [Purge_dups](https://github.com/dfguan/purge_dups) here, but the **most important** thing is to learn how to interpret the results after purge_dups is done. So, João and I have generated for you the (i) purged assebmlies, (ii) the merqury and the (iii) BUSCO results.

1-) First thing you need to do is to symlink the purged assemblies and calculate the general statistics for the primary and haplotigs files. Let's create a new directory to save the purged results and create the symlinks there:

```console  
mkdir ~/<your_species>/purged/
cd ~/<your_species>/purged/
ln -s ~/Share/drUrtUren1_data/purged/purged.fa.gz
ln -s ~/Share/drUrtUren1_data/purged/purged.htigs.fa.gz
```  

And now export our scripts directory and run the `asmstats` script for each of them:

```console
export PATH=$PATH:~/Share/scripts/
asmstats purged.fa.gz > purged.fa.gz.stats
asmstats purged.htigs.fa.gz > purged.htigs.fa.gz.stats
```

Great!

2-) Now, I want you to take a look and take notes of the BUSCO results **before** and **after** purging for the Hifiasm drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.p_ctg.fa.gz and drUrtUren1.hifiasm.total.a_ctg.fa.gz assembly. The short short_summary.txt is the file you should look at. You can do that by using the `less` command:

before purging:

Prinary:
```
less ~/Share/<species_id>_data/run_drUrtUren1.hifiasm.p.busco_odb10/short_summary.txt
```
haplotigs:
```
less ~/Share/<species_id>_data/run_drUrtUren1.hifiasm.a.busco_odb10/short_summary.txt (running, copy when done)
```
after purging:  

Primary:
```
less ~/Share/<species_id>_data/run_drUrtUren1.purged.busco_odb10/short_summary.txt
```
htigs:
```
less ~/Share/<species_id>_data/run_drUrtUren1.purged_htigs.busco_odb10/short_summary.txt
```

Right, now let's have a look at the merqury results. If the one your group is running for the Hicanu assembly is not done yet, we can start having a look at the purged results. Merqury is going to create a lot of different files: (i) different plot (.png) files, (ii) a <outname>.completeness.stats file and (iii) a <outputname>.qv file.  
    
The merqury results for the purged assemblies are located in this directory: `~/Share/<species_id>_data/purged/merqury_purged_eval` (you don't need to copy anything yet). 
  
# About the Merqury output files
 
For the plot files, you will have 3 types: st (stacked), ln (line) and fl (filled). 
### These three graphs will represent the same data
they are just a different way of plotting the (same) data. For further information I recommend having a look at the manual [here](https://github.com/marbl/merqury/wiki/2.-Overall-k-mer-evaluation).
   
# Attention
Apart from having st, fn and ln, merqury is going to output 2 types of files, *asm* and *cn*. If the file contains *cn* it's going to show you all kmer counts of primary + haplotigs in the plot, without descriminating them. Ff it contains *asm* it is going to show you kmers belonging to each assembly in different colours. 

DEEP BREATH.

You are going to get it! (It just takes time!). 

Didn't get it yet? Discuss it with your group on zoom!
     
What you need to do with the purging merqury results is:
Now I want you to take a look at some relevant Merqury files. The text files can be open with the `less` command, while you will need to download the plot files (*.png) to your local machine in order to actually open them. 
  
  3-) Gather the spectra plots for the primary purged assembly. They will be called `purged.purged.spectra-cn*.png` (notice that the `*` represents the different files we have: `st`, `ln` and `st`)
  
  4-) Gather the spectra plots for the haplotigs purged assembly. It will be called `purged.purged.htigs.spectra-cn*.png`
  
  5-) Gather the completeness results for the run. The file ends in `completeness.stats`
  
  6-) Gather the QV results for the run. The file is called `purged.qv`
  
By the time you finish gathering all of these results, it's very likely that the merqury run for the Hifiasm has finished. Please go and have a look at the same 3,4,5 and 6 questions for the Hifiasm run.
  
Now that you have all the results organized, let's interpret them and discuss with your group while you make your group presentation.
  
  - show the statistics for the Hifiasm p and a assemblies
  - show the busco short summary for the Hifiasm assemblies
  - show the spectra plot for the Hifiasm assemblies (one of the files st, ln or fn)
  - show the completeness for the Hifiasm assemblies
  - show the QV for the Hifiasm assemblies.
  
  Go and do the same for the primary purged assembly:
  
  - show the statistics for the purged assembly
  - show the busco short summary for the purged assembly
  - show the spectra plot for the purged assembly (one of the files st, ln or fn)
  - show the completeness for the purged assembly
  - show the QV for the purged assembly.
  
  
  Go and do the same for the htigs purged assembly:
  
   - show the statistics for the purged.htigs assembly
  - show the busco short summary for the purged.htigs assembly
  - show the spectra plot for the purged.htigs assembly (one of the files st, ln or fn)
  - show the completeness for the purged.htigs assembly
  - show the QV for the purged.htigs assembly.
  
  
# Attention!
  
For the purged run, the qv and completeness result for the purged and htigs assembly will be in the same files. Understand what each column of the files qv and completeness mean by reading the manual again:  https://github.com/marbl/merqury/wiki/2.-Overall-k-mer-evaluation
  
 # Now  
  
  I don't know if you realised, but you have for now (i) ran kmer analyses to understand the DNA composition of your reads, (ii) you have ran two genome assemblers and you are learning how to (iii) interprete the BUSCO run results and how to run (iv) and interpret (v) kmer assembly evaluation results with merqury! THIS IS A LOT FOR THREE DAYS! Really well done! Now its time to gather all of the results and answer the following questions with your team and later on we will go through them together as a group.
  
  
  a-) What has happened with the assembly general statistics after it was purged?
  
  b-) After purging, what the files purged and htigs mean?
  
  c-) How is the BUSCO duplication before purging?
  
  d-) How is the busco duplication in the purged assembly after purging? Why has it changed?
  
  e-) What are all the QVs of the assemblies? Are they good QVs? 
  
  f-) What a QV of 50 means?
  
  Well done! Let's come back to the group all together now!
