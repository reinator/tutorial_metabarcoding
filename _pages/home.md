Welcome to the [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/) November 2020 course run by Marcela Uliano & João Ferreira.

Follow the links on the lefthand side to take part in the course modules.

Eukaryotic genomes may be composed of many repeats. Long reads sequencing technologies can span most of those repeats and produce genome assemblies with unprecedented contiguity. Further, sequencing technologies such as PacBio HiFi give us assembly contiguity and base accuracy. Chromatin conformation capture reads (Hi-C) bring the final information to scaffold assemblies into chromosomes.

This course will introduce the audience to a spectre of methods which are present in a usual assembly workflow, starting from raw data and finishing with a fully assembled genome. We will see how to manipulate raw reads, analyse their quality, how to run different assembly algorithms, how to run Hi-C scaffolding algorithms and how to analyse assembly quality.
